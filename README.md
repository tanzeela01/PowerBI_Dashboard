## Project Overview

This project is a guided analysis of employee attendance records for a company over a three-month period. The dataset used contains attendance data for multiple employees. The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Calculate real-time attendance percentages for various categories, including:
   - Sick leave percentage
   - Work from home (WFH) percentage
   - The trends in these percentages, particularly in weekdays

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

In this project, the provided dataset was initially in a wide format with dates scattered across multiple columns. To facilitate analysis, the data was transformed into a long format, which made it easier to work with. Key data preparation steps include:

- Converting the wide table into a long one to gather all the date-related information into a single column for analysis.

## Analysis and Objectives

The main objectives of this project's analysis are:

1. **Calculate Attendance Percentages:**
   - Calculate the Sick leave percentage by analyzing the data for sick leave entries.
   - Calculate the Work from home (WFH) percentage by analyzing the data for WFH entries.

2. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Analyze the trends in these percentages, especially on weekdays.
   - Identify patterns and insights, such as the highest WFH percentage on a specific day of the week (e.g., Friday).
